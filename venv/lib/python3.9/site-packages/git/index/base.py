    """
    Implements an Index that can be manipulated using a native implementation in
    order to save git command function calls wherever possible.

    It provides custom merging facilities allowing to merge without actually changing
    your index or your working tree. This way you can perform own test-merges based
    on the index only without having to deal with the working copy. This is useful
    in case of partial working trees.

    ``Entries``

    The index contains an entries dict whose keys are tuples of type IndexEntry
    to facilitate access.

    You may read the entries dict or manipulate it using IndexEntry instance, i.e.::

        index.entries[index.entry_key(index_entry_instance)] = index_entry_instance

    Make sure you use index.write() once you are done manipulating the index directly
    before operating on it using the git command"""

        :param items:
            Multiple types of items are supported, types can be mixed within one call.
            Different types imply a different handling. File paths may generally be
            relative or absolute.

            - path string
                strings denote a relative or absolute path into the repository pointing to
                an existing file, i.e. CHANGES, lib/myfile.ext, '/home/gitrepo/lib/myfile.ext'.

                Absolute paths must start with working tree directory of this index's repository
                to be considered valid. For example, if it was initialized with a non-normalized path, like
                `/root/repo/../repo`, absolute paths to be added must start with `/root/repo/../repo`.

                Paths provided like this must exist. When added, they will be written
                into the object database.

                PathStrings may contain globs, such as 'lib/__init__*' or can be directories
                like 'lib', the latter ones will add all the files within the directory and
                subdirectories.

                This equals a straight git-add.

                They are added at stage 0

            - Blob or Submodule object
                Blobs are added as they are assuming a valid mode is set.
                The file they refer to may or may not exist in the file system, but
                must be a path relative to our repository.

                If their sha is null ( 40*0 ), their path must exist in the file system
                relative to the git repository as an object will be created from
                the data at the path.
                The handling now very much equals the way string paths are processed, except that
                the mode you have set will be kept. This allows you to create symlinks
                by settings the mode respectively and writing the target of the symlink
                directly into the file. This equals a default Linux-Symlink which
                is not dereferenced automatically, except that it can be created on
                filesystems not supporting it as well.

                Please note that globs or directories are not allowed in Blob objects.

                They are added at stage 0

            - BaseIndexEntry or type
                Handling equals the one of Blob objects, but the stage may be
                explicitly set. Please note that Index Entries require binary sha's.

        :param force:
            **CURRENTLY INEFFECTIVE**
            If True, otherwise ignored or excluded files will be
            added anyway.
            As opposed to the git-add command, we enable this flag by default
            as the API user usually wants the item to be added even though
            they might be excluded.

        :param fprogress:
            Function with signature f(path, done=False, item=item) called for each
            path to be added, one time once it is about to be added where done==False
            and once after it was added where done=True.
            item is set to the actual item we handle, either a Path or a BaseIndexEntry
            Please note that the processed path is not guaranteed to be present
            in the index already as the index is currently being processed.

        :param path_rewriter:
            Function with signature (string) func(BaseIndexEntry) function returning a path
            for each passed entry which is the path to be actually recorded for the
            object created from entry.path. This allows you to write an index which
            is not identical to the layout of the actual files on your hard-disk.
            If not None and ``items`` contain plain paths, these paths will be
            converted to Entries beforehand and passed to the path_rewriter.
            Please note that entry.path is relative to the git repository.

        :param write:
            If True, the index will be written once it was altered. Otherwise
            the changes only exist in memory and are not available to git commands.

        :param write_extension_data:
            If True, extension data will be written back to the index. This can lead to issues in case
            it is containing the 'TREE' extension, which will cause the `git commit` command to write an
            old tree, instead of a new one representing the now changed index.
            This doesn't matter if you use `IndexFile.commit()`, which ignores the `TREE` extension altogether.
            You should set it to True if you intend to use `IndexFile.commit()` exclusively while maintaining
            support for third-party extensions. Besides that, you can usually safely ignore the built-in
            extensions when using GitPython on repositories that are not handled manually at all.
            All current built-in extensions are listed here:
