# PyPasser

**PyPasser** is a Python library for bypassing reCaptchaV3 only by sending HTTP requests and solving reCaptchaV2 using speech-to-text engine.

🔴 reCaptchaV3 bypass does not work on all sites. Test on your target to find out.

🐍 Support Python >= 3.7

# Installation

### Install from PyPI

```
pip install PyPasser
```

### And for update

```
pip install PyPasser --upgrade
```

&nbsp;

### Install from Github (latest repo code)

```
pip install git+https://github.com/xHossein/PyPasser@master
```

&nbsp;


# Bypassing **reCaptchaV3**

To bypass recaptcha v3, first you must find anchor URL.

- Open inspect-element on your browser.
- Go to the web page that has reCaptcha V3 (not V2 invisible).
- In Network tab you should see many requests.
- Type `anchor` in text-field filter to hide unnecessary requests.
- Now you should see a url like this:

  > ``https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfCVLAUAAAAFwwRnnCFW_J39&co=aHR....``
  >

  pass this url to `reCaptchaV3` class:

Note that the anchor urls also can have `/enterprise/anchor` instead of `/api2/anchor` in other sites.

&nbsp;

```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV3

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL')
## use this response in your request ...
```

Some good examples are [here](https://github.com/xHossein/PyPasser/tree/master/examples/reCaptchaV3).

&nbsp;

### **Proxy**

```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV3
from pypasser.structs import Proxy

## Using Proxy structure
proxy = Proxy(Proxy.type.HTTPs,'HOST','PORT')

## with authentication credentials
# proxy = Proxy(Proxy.type.HTTPs,'HOST','PORT','USERNAME', 'PASSWORD')

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL', proxy)
```

_also you can configure it as Dict._

```python

proxy = {"http": "http://HOST:PORT",
         "https": "https://HOST:PORT"}

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL', proxy)
```

&nbsp;

### **Timeout**

Default timeout is `20 seconds` but you can change the amount like this:

```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV3

reCaptcha_response = reCaptchaV3('ANCHOR URL', timeout = 10)
```

&nbsp;

# Bypassing **reCaptchaV2**
Before start using reCaptchaV2 solver, you must install the following requirements.
### **Requirements** :
- **PocketSphinx** (used as speech-to-text engine)
- **ffmpeg** (used for audio format conversion)

After installing requirements, you should pass your webdriver to reCaptchaV2 class then PyPasser tries to solve the reCaptcha V2 which is in current tab of browser.
```python
from pypasser import reCaptchaV2

# Create an instance of webdriver and open the page has recaptcha v2
# ...

# pass the driver to reCaptchaV2
is_checked = reCaptchaV2(driver_instance) # it returns bool

```

&nbsp;

### **Arguments**
**driver**: An instance of webdriver.\
**Play**: Click on 'PLAY' button. [Default is True means it plays the audio].\
**Attempts**: Maximum solving attempts for a recaptcha. [Default is 3 times].

```python
is_checked = reCaptchaV2(
                    driver = driver_instance,
                    play = False,
                    attempts = 5
                  )

```


See an example [here](https://github.com/xHossein/PyPasser/blob/master/examples/reCaptchaV2/demo.py).

> Note that Google gonna blocks you if you try to solve many recaptcha via audio challenge. In this case PyPasser raises `IpBlock` exception.

&nbsp;

# Exception

| Exception | Bypass | Description |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| ConnectionError | reCaptchaV3 | Raised due to network connectivity-related issues. |
| RecaptchaTokenNotFound | reCaptchaV3 | Raised when couldn't find token due to wrong `anchor_url`. |
| RecaptchaResponseNotFound | reCaptchaV3 | Raised when couldn't find reCaptcha response due to using **PyPasser** for site that hasn't reCaptchaV3. |
| IpBlock | reCaptchaV2 | Raised due to solving many recaptcha via audio challenge. |
