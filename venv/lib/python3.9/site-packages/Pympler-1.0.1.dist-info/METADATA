README for pympler
==================

Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the memory
behavior of Python objects in a running Python application.

By pympling a Python application, detailed insight in the size and the lifetime
of Python objects can be obtained.  Undesirable or unexpected runtime behavior
like memory bloat and other "pymples" can easily be identified.

Pympler integrates three previously separate projects into a single,
comprehensive profiling tool. Asizeof provides basic size information for one
or several Python objects, muppy is used for on-line monitoring of a Python
application and the class tracker provides off-line analysis of the lifetime of
selected Python objects. A web profiling frontend exposes process statistics,
garbage visualisation and class tracker statistics.

Pympler is written entirely in Python, with no dependencies to external
libraries. It has been tested with Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 on Linux,
Windows and MacOS X.
