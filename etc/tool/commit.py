AI Commit Message Generator using gpt4free (g4f)

This tool uses AI to generate meaningful git commit messages based on 
staged changes. It analyzes the git diff and suggests appropriate commit 
messages following conventional commit format.

Usage:

    Analyze ONLY the exact changes in this git diff and create a precise commit message.

    FORMAT:
    1. First line: "<type>: <summary>" (max 70 chars)
       - Type: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, etc.
       - Summary must describe ONLY actual changes shown in the diff
       
    2. Leave one blank line

    3. 2-4 bullet points that:
       - Describe ONLY specific changes seen in the diff
       - Reference exact functions/files/components that were modified
       - Do NOT mention anything not explicitly shown in the code changes
       - Avoid general statements or assumptions not directly visible in diff

    IMPORTANT: Be 100% factual. Only mention code that was actually changed. Never invent or assume changes not shown in the diff. If unsure about a change's purpose, describe what changed rather than why. Output nothing except for the commit message, and don't surround it in quotes.
